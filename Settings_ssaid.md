You're absolutely on the right track ‚Äî the settings_ssaid.xml file stores the SSAID (Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID), which is per-app-per-user starting Android 8+, and it's the primary identifier many apps (especially Firebase-based) rely on.

You're right that:

Changing it via an app manually works, but isn't scalable.

adb shell settings put secure android_id ... does not work post-Android 8+, because Android ignores direct SSAID writes due to security model changes.


So let's walk through better, automatable ways to change this ID.

‚úÖ GOAL: Automate SSAID (ANDROID_ID) Spoofing

Here are viable automatable approaches depending on your access level:


---

‚úÖ Option 1: Direct File Injection via ADB + Root

Since settings_ssaid.xml is typically located at:

/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml

You can edit and replace this file using adb and root:

# Pull, modify, push method
adb root
adb remount

adb pull /data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml

# Now modify the XML locally using Python or sed
# Example: change android_id value inside the file
sed -i 's/android_id" value=".*"/android_id" value="RANDOM_ID_HERE"/' settings_ssaid.xml

# Push it back
adb push settings_ssaid.xml /data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml

# Set correct permissions
adb shell chmod 660 /data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml
adb shell chown system:system /data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml

# Reboot to apply
adb reboot

‚úÖ Automatable. You can generate random SSAIDs each time with a script and fully automate it.


---

‚úÖ Option 2: Modify in Memory via Magisk Module (Advanced)

If you're using Magisk, you can hook or override the call to Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID:

Use XPrivacyLua, LSPosed, or write a custom Magisk module or Riru module that intercepts Settings.Secure.getString() for ANDROID_ID.


Or:

Use MagiskHidePropsConfig + resetprop to spoof a consistent Android ID across the system.


resetprop persist.service.adb.enable 1
resetprop persist.sys.android_id <your_new_random_id>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only works if the app accepts global spoofing and doesn‚Äôt double-check SSAID from settings_ssaid.xml.




---

‚úÖ Option 3: Boot Fresh Emulator Images with Random SSAID

If you‚Äôre using QEMU-based Android images:

1. Prepare a base AOSP image.


2. Script qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b base.img fresh.img


3. Boot fresh image, push app, randomize SSAID using method above.


4. Use automation tool (e.g., uiautomator2) to perform login.


5. Destroy image and repeat.



‚úÖ Fully stateless automation.


---

‚úÖ Option 4: Use a Custom App to Set SSAID Programmatically

You mentioned doing it via an app ‚Äî to automate:

Build a minimal APK that runs on startup and sets a random SSAID in /data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml

Have it su and rewrite the file during boot, then soft-reboot.



---

‚úÖ Bonus: Script Generator (Python + ADB)

Here‚Äôs a quick Python function to automate the SSAID rewrite:

import random
import subprocess

def generate_random_ssaid():
    return ''.join(random.choices('0123456789abcdef', k=16))

def replace_ssaid(ssaid):
    subprocess.run(["adb", "root"])
    subprocess.run(["adb", "remount"])
    subprocess.run(["adb", "pull", "/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml", "ssaid.xml"])

    with open("ssaid.xml", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    content = re.sub(r'android_id" value="[^"]+"', f'android_id" value="{ssaid}"', content)
    with open("ssaid.xml", "w") as f:
        f.write(content)

    subprocess.run(["adb", "push", "ssaid.xml", "/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml"])
    subprocess.run(["adb", "shell", "chmod", "660", "/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml"])
    subprocess.run(["adb", "shell", "chown", "system:system", "/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml"])
    subprocess.run(["adb", "reboot"])

replace_ssaid(generate_random_ssaid())

üîê TL;DR

Method	Root Required	Fully Automatable	Notes

Modify settings_ssaid.xml	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Best method
Use XPrivacyLua or Magisk	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	For deep spoofing
Use new emulator image	‚ùå Optional	‚úÖ Yes	Stateless but slower
adb settings put secure	‚ùå No	‚ùå No	Ignored on Android 8+

Let me know your exact emulator base (AOSP, Android version, rooted or not) and I can write a full script tailored to it.
