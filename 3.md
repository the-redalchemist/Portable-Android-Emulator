If you're getting an error like "KVM: no such file or directory" when trying to run QEMU inside a Docker container, it means your container doesn‚Äôt have access to KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), which is necessary for hardware acceleration.

Here‚Äôs how to resolve this:


---

‚úÖ 1. Ensure Host Has KVM

Make sure your host machine supports KVM and has it loaded:

ls -la /dev/kvm

If /dev/kvm exists, KVM is available.

If it does not exist, enable virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI and install KVM modules:

# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
sudo modprobe kvm


---

‚úÖ 2. Run Docker with KVM Device Mapped

Run the container with /dev/kvm passed in:

docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/kvm \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  your-image-name

> ‚úÖ --device /dev/kvm gives the container access to KVM. ‚úÖ --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN and --security-opt seccomp=unconfined are sometimes needed for QEMU inside containers.




---

‚úÖ 3. Check Permissions

Inside the container, ensure /dev/kvm exists:

ls -l /dev/kvm

If permissions are wrong, try this (on host or in Dockerfile):

chmod 666 /dev/kvm


---

‚úÖ 4. Dockerfile Hints

If you're building a custom image for Android x86 emulation, ensure you have QEMU installed:

RUN apt update && apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm

Also, install Android x86 ISO or an emulator image inside your image, or mount it at runtime.


---

üß™ 5. Verify QEMU Uses KVM

Inside the container, try:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm

If you get:

Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory

Then /dev/kvm is either not present or not accessible.

‚ùó Common Pitfalls

Problem	Fix

/dev/kvm missing on host	Enable virtualization in BIOS
Running on macOS/Windows	KVM only works on Linux
Running in WSL2	KVM isn‚Äôt supported directly in WSL2
Permissions issue	chmod 666 /dev/kvm or adjust group access

If you share the exact error message, Dockerfile, or your docker run command, I can give more specific help.




Got it. If you're still seeing KVM: No such file or directory even when using --device /dev/kvm, here‚Äôs a detailed step-by-step checklist and diagnostics to pinpoint the problem.

üîç Step-by-Step Debugging

‚úÖ 1. Is /dev/kvm Available on the Host?

Run this on your host machine:

ls -l /dev/kvm

If it says No such file or directory, your host doesn‚Äôt have KVM loaded. Try:

sudo modprobe kvm
sudo modprobe kvm_intel   # for Intel CPUs
# OR
sudo modprobe kvm_amd     # for AMD CPUs

Then recheck /dev/kvm.


---

‚úÖ 2. Does Your CPU Support Virtualization?

Check CPU flags:

egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

If this returns 0, your CPU doesn‚Äôt support virtualization or it‚Äôs disabled in the BIOS/UEFI.


Enable VT-x (Intel) or SVM (AMD) in BIOS.


---

‚úÖ 3. Is KVM Working Outside Docker?

Before using Docker, test KVM on the host:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 512 -nographic -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)

(You can use any simple bootable kernel for this test.)

If this fails, the problem is with your host setup, not Docker.


---

‚úÖ 4. Run Docker Container with Full KVM Access

Try this full command:

docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/kvm \
  --group-add $(getent group kvm | cut -d: -f3) \
  --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  ubuntu bash

This:

Mounts /dev/kvm

Adds container user to the KVM group

Loosens security settings needed by QEMU


Inside that container:

apt update && apt install -y qemu-system-x86
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm

What happens?


---

‚úÖ 5. Check Permissions of /dev/kvm Inside Container

Inside your container:

ls -l /dev/kvm

Should be something like:

crw-rw---- 1 root kvm 10, 232 Jul 28 17:00 /dev/kvm

Make sure the container user is in the kvm group.


---

üß± If You're Still Stuck

Please tell me:

1. Output of ls -l /dev/kvm on host and in container


2. Your docker run command


3. Output of egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo


4. Whether you‚Äôre using bare-metal Linux, WSL2, macOS, or cloud VM




---

I can then give you a minimal working example or suggest a workaround (like using software emulation if KVM is impossible).
